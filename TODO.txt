TODOs
-----

- fix known issues (see README.txt)
- refactor map portrayal configuration:

  - use one piece of user-defined javascript to show the map
  - small set of hooks and callbacks (for loading/storing lat,lon,zoom, etc)
    which are needed to interact with UM
  - factor feed-related things into separate js and abstract from them
    by having a layer (later markers will be used instead of feeds)
  - some configuration parameters are still needed in UM backend
    (srsname, map server URI, resolutions, etc). 
  - when this is done, map_search can get use of OSM and also there will be no
    need for the separate getmap_custom_*
