<h2>Container widget</h2>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Container widget (aka combo-widget) is needed to display 
several widgets as one block (in one iframe). This widget can be used on external websites as well as on the topic page. 

<br /></p>

<p>
To create a widget, specify one or more (up to 9) URLs of 
the other widgets. To get a widget URL, make it's HTML, copy URL from the
textarea at the bottom of that widget page.

<br />
It is also possible to include a header (similar to other widgets).

<br />
It should be noted, that due to limitations of URL length in some
web browsers (MS InternetExplorer 6 and 7 limit URL lenght to 2048 characters), the number of widgets 
may be limited. The limitation doesn't concern widget shown
on the topic page.
