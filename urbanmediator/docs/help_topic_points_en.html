<h2>Topicâ€™s point list widget</h2>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You can create a web
widget that shows the most recent points submitted to the topic. This
topic is best used for external websites. Remember to choose the
number of points to be display and test to find a convenient height
and width for the widget. It is also possible to include a header
(similarly as for the Add Point widget).</p>
