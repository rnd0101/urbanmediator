<h2>Advanced settings for topic page</h2>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Once you have created a
basic topic page, you can customize it further by editing the
advanced settings (available under Settings): 
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>1. Topic page elements:</p>
<p>You can choose which
elements appear on the topic page’s right hand side column, and in
which order they appear (the order of appearance on the topic right
hand side column is from up to down and corresponds to the order in
the settings field, from left to right):</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>new point button: the
default “Add new point” button that automatically appears when a
topic is created (see Figure 1). You might consider removing this
default button if you create customized buttons using the Widgets
options (see Figure 2).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>widgets: any widget
created for a particular topic using the widgetizers functionalities
of Urban Mediator. The widgetizers are available under the Widget
section. Widgets can be imbedded in the Topic page and their order of
appearance on the right-hand side topic column is set here. The most
common widgets to add to the Topic page are the Add Point button
ones.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>search: the search
topic field (for searching the topic only, not the whole Urban
Mediator)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>tagcloud: a tagcloud
showing the most used tags in the points created for this topic</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>triggers: and advanced
features that can connect urban mediator to other systems</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>hr: the diamond shape
graphical elements that acts as a separator between elements of the
topic’s right-hand side column</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>2. Point display</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You can choose what
kind of information is shown for each point, on the topic points
list:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>title: The title of the
point, as provided by the point creator</p>
<p>added: the time when
the point was added</p>
<p>url: if the point is
linked to an external web page, this page’s URL would appear</p>
<p>description-full: the
full description for the point, as provided by the point creator</p>
<p>author: the username of
the creator of the point, or the visitor number if the point was
created anonymously</p>
<p>tags: the keywords
attached to the point (both hidden ones set by the topic creator and
the ones chosen by the point creator)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>3. Default view mode</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You can choose whether
the default view for your topic page shows the map or the list of
points. Both view are of course always available to users by clicking
on the map and list link on the topic view.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>4. Point view order</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You can set the default
view for the topic’s point list:</p>
<p>recently updated: shows
the most recently updated points first 
</p>
<p>newest: shows the
newest created points first</p>
<p>title: shows the list
of points ordered according to the alphabetical order of the points
titles</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>5. Who can add points</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You can choose who can
add points to your topic:</p>
<p>anyone: Anyone can
submit anonymously, without even typing the security number
verification. This makes it possible for anyone to quickly submit
points anonymously, but this might encourage spam.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>visitors: Anyone can
submit, using their own username and password, or anonymously.
Anonymous users have to however type a security number.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>registered: Only users
who have registered to UM can submit points.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>topic administrators:
Only the topic administrators can submit points.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>nobody: There is no
possibility to submit points to a topic. This possibility is handy
for topics that receive their information as feeds from other systems
of websites, and do not require users to submit information (see
Figure 1). Moreover, this possibility can be chosen if the topic
would need to stop being active and would no more need to receive
information from users.</p>
<p><br />
