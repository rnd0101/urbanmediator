<h2>Create a “Add point” button</h2>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You can create
customized “Add point” buttons for both your topic page and for
imbedding on any other website. For that, you need to go to Widgets
and choose “Add point button”. (remember that you have to be
logged in as the creator of the topic).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The critical
information to fill is the following:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Widget Basic Settings:</p>
<p>- Text that will show
on button</p>
<p>- Text to show when
point creation is disabled</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Add Point page Basic
Settings:</p>
<p>- Point title example 
</p>
<p>- List of fixed hidden
tags <font></font> these tags are set by the
topic admin and are always attached to any point a user creates,
using this widget. These tags especially help topic owners to filter
the information collected according to their own needs.</p>
<p>- List of predefined
tags (leave empty for none) <font></font> this
feature is still more experimental 
</p>
<p>- Free tags (user's
own)</p>
<p>- Point Tags example
(for free tags)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If you want to embed
the widget into an external page, you might consider adding a header
to the button itself. This header can show the UM logo as well as a
title and subtitle. 
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>An Add Point button
without header is suitable for the Topic page, e.g.:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><img src="help_submit_html_47d388a7.png" name="graphics1" align="BOTTOM" border="0" /></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>For an external page,
it might be interesting to have more information, in the “header”,
e.g.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><img src="help_submit_html_m5c0bb6ce.png" name="graphics2" align="BOTTOM" border="0" />
