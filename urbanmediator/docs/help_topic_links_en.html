<h2>Topicâ€™s link list widget</h2>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You can create a web widget that shows the links the topic has.

This widget can be used on external websites as well as on the topic page. 

Remember to choose the number of points to be displayed and test to find a convenient height
and width for the widget. It is also possible to include a header
(similarly as for the Add Point widget).</p>
